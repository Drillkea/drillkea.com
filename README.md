# Drillkea.com (static) source code

This is the source code for drillkea.com, it used to be a dynamic website running on HT Web-Framework V1 until 2022.\
Back then I had a lot less knowledge so it is probably flawed to the core but its still working.

Changes can be requested by anyone from Drillkea, so they can update their own profile or add/modify own pages.

Short snippets from the code can be used for personal projects, but not stealing of entire pages/the entire project.\
All media (except profile pictures, they belong to their rightful owner) is property of me (Hammer1279) and can only be used somewhere else with my prior approval.

All Drillkea logos are used under fair use and were never intended to impersonate or compete with anyone and were never used for-profit.

Volcanoids is a game made by Volcanoid s.r.o. and is not affiliated with any Drillkea group action or this website.\
IKEAÂ® is not affiliated or endorsing any action taken by the Drillkea group and is totally unrelated to this.\
Both only inspired the creation of the Drillkea group.
